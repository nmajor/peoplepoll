	"Summaries" : 
			[
		"The problem with illegal immigration is that the social cost out weighs the economic benefit. The money we spend on illegals takes away resources from our children's education, health care for our elderly, our military and better infrastructure. ",
		"The top 1% of our society own 99% of all of the wealth.  This gives them unfair advantages in the market which are not available to the rest of us.  Only govenement has enough power to redistribute wealth to from the rich to the deserving middle class.  ",
		"The current minimum wage is insufficient for hard working men and women to live comfortably in America.   Most hard working American families have to work two or three jobs employers are offering less hours due to healthcare mandates. "

		"I will create a bounty system with a $1000 reward to anyone who can provide the USCIS with the name, picture and location of any illegal person.  There will be a $100 fee to apply for the reward.  This fee will be given to target individual in the case where the bounty hunter identified a legal resident.  I also will increase the deportation capacity and efficiency of the USICS so that people who are in this country illegally will be deported within 24 hrs.",
		"I propose that we to increase the federal income tax rate to 40% for people making over $250K, 60% for people making over $500K and 80% for people making over 1 million.",
		"I propose that we double the current minimum wage so that people can live move comfortably.  With rising healthcare costs, employers will be required to provide health care benefits to both full and part-time employees."
